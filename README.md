# SPPU (2019 Pattern) Data Structures & Algorithms Laboratory Practicals

## Practical01
- **Objective:** Represent a given graph using an adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS, and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph; identify the prominent landmarks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

## Practical02
- **Objective:** There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B, then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takes to reach city B from A or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

## Practical03
- **Objective:** A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections, and sections consist of subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.

## Practical04
- **Objective:** Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression e.g., +--a*bc/def and traverse it using post-order traversal (non-recursive), and then delete the entire tree.

## Practical05
- **Objective:** Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
  1. Insert new node
  2. Find number of nodes in longest path from root
  3. Minimum data value found in the tree
  4. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
  5. Search a value

## Practical06
- **Objective:** Consider a telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using the number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers.

## Practical07
- **Objective:** Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using chaining with / without replacement.
  Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys must be unique.
  Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

## Practical08
- **Objective:** Given a sequence k = k1 < k2 < … < kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each key ki. Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access probability for each key.

## Practical09
- **Objective:** A Dictionary stores keywords and their meanings. Provide facilities for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide a facility to display the whole data sorted in ascending/descending order. Also, find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

## Practical10
- **Objective:** Read marks obtained by students in an online examination for a specific subject. Find out maximum and minimum marks obtained in that subject. Use heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm.

## Practical11
- **Objective:** The department maintains student information. The file contains roll number, name, division, and address. Allow the user to add, delete information of the student. Display information of a particular employee. If the record of the student does not exist, an appropriate message is displayed. If it does, then the system displays the student details. Use a sequential file to maintain the data.

## Practical12
- **Objective:** Assume we have two input and two output tapes to perform the sorting. The internal memory can hold and sort m records at a time. Write a program in java for external sorting. Find out time complexity.
